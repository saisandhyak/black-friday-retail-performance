## Overview

YES — good instinct 😅
It *is* a bit too casual for GitHub if you’re targeting recruiters / interviewers.

Let’s **dial it down**, keep it **natural and confident**, but remove the slangy / diary-like bits.
Think: *clear, reflective, professional — but still human.*

Below is a **cleaned-up version in your voice**, just more polished.

## 🛍️ Black Friday Retail Performance Analysis (2024–2025)

## Project Background

I initially built a Black Friday sales dashboard to explore retail performance, but after reviewing it, I felt it was more descriptive than insightful. While it showed multiple charts and metrics, it didn’t clearly explain *why* performance looked the way it did or what decisions could be made from it.

This project is a **reworked and improved version** of that analysis, rebuilt with a stronger focus on business questions, performance drivers, and decision support.

## What changed in this version

### 1. Clear structure and storytelling

Instead of treating all visuals equally, the dashboard now follows a clear flow:

* Overall performance context
* Key revenue drivers
* Promotion effectiveness
* Time-based behavior during Black Friday
* Insights and recommendations

This makes it easier to understand what matters first and where to focus attention.

### 2. KPI-driven performance view

The dashboard starts with high-level KPIs that answer immediate business questions:

* Expected vs Actual Revenue
* Year-over-Year Revenue Change
* Promotional Uplift %
* Gross Margin %

These KPIs set the context before diving into deeper analysis.

### 3. Category-level driver analysis

Revenue by category shows **Electronics as the dominant driver**, contributing **49% of total revenue**.

At the same time, Electronics operates at a **22% margin**, slightly below the overall margin. This highlights:

* Heavy reliance on one category for revenue
* Increased risk if pricing or promotions underperform in that category

The analysis focuses not just on which category leads, but why that leadership matters.

### 4. Promotion effectiveness evaluation

Promotion analysis revealed that:

* Orders without promotions generated the highest revenue
* Promotional uplift was negative (-23%)
* Higher discounts did not translate into proportional revenue gains and reduced margins

This suggests promotions were not as effective as expected and may have applied unnecessary margin pressure.

### 5. Time-based focus on Black Friday week

Instead of a full-year trend, the dashboard zooms into **daily revenue during Black Friday week**.

This highlights:

* A sharp spike on Black Friday itself
* Revenue being highly concentrated in a short window rather than sustained over multiple days

This has implications for inventory planning, staffing, and promotion timing.

### 6. Insights and recommendations embedded

The dashboard includes:

* **Executive Insights** summarizing key findings
* **Recommendations** translating analysis into actionable steps

This ensures the analysis goes beyond reporting and supports decision-making.
## Repository Contents

* Raw datasets for 2024 and 2025:

  * Orders
  * Products
  * Promotions
  * Stores
* Power BI file (`.pbix`) containing:

  * Data cleaning and transformation
  * Data modeling
  * Measures and calculations
  * Final dashboard
* Dashboard screenshots for reference

## Key takeaway

This project demonstrates how restructuring the same data around business questions can significantly improve clarity and impact. The updated dashboard focuses on **drivers, trade-offs, and decisions**, rather than isolated metrics.
